        <p>Structuring a webpage has always been an essential part of web development. HTML stands for the hypertext markup
        language, and it is the standard markup language for creating structured web pages. HTML5 is the fifth rendition of HTML
        and introduces new elements that are even more important for structuring and presenting the contents of a webpage.</p>
        <p>An HTML document is nothing without the elements that tell our browser what we want to display. One of the most critical
        elements is the div element which acts as a container by helping group elements—enclosing other tags is a great way to
        structure a web page layout.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The div container helps with the look of a website structure, but that's all it can do. For example, a div element
            may
            look nice in the output window but fails at informing the browser of its purpose. The div element is also known as a
            general container element.</li>
          <li>Generic div containers bring challenges for people relying on screen reader software. For example, if the browser
            can't
            make out the tags used on a website, then some information about the contents found on a webpage is left unspoken. A
            problem that leads visually impaired people to become very frustrated with a sense of feeling left out.</li>

        <p>in order to write an HTML document we have to understand the basic principles of an Element. Elements are comprised of
        what’s called tags and every element has the potential to follow this structure.</p>
            <code>
              <h3>Element Examples</h3>
              &lt;p>This is a paragraph tag&lt;/p>
              &lt;h1>This is a heading tag for titles&lt;/h1>
              &lt;a>This is a Anchor tag for links &lt;/a>
            </code>
         

        <ul>
          <li>To write an HTML, you need to write it in an HTML file format. Typically index.html is the first file you create for
          your web page; before writing HTML, it's good for understanding the basic principles of an Element. Elements have tag
          names; an element has an open and closed tag name to descibe that specific content.</li>
          <li>There are many different Elements to choose from when writing HTML. A few essential elements are the paragraph tag
          allows us to write plain body text. The Heading Tag outlines the main title for the sub-titles. The Anchor Tag allows us
          to add a clickable link. lastly, the image tag allows us to add images to our webpage.</li>
        </ul>

      <header>HTML & HTML5</header>
      <article>
        <p>HTML5 introduced new container elements. For example, elements that properly help define the layout of a webpage for
        Bette structuring, like the header, nav, section, and footer, to name a few, are all elements of the document's
        structure.</p>

        <code>
          <h3>Using Generic HTML</h3>
          &lt;!DOCTYPE html>
        &lt;html lang="en">

        &lt;head>
          meta data
        &lt;/head>
        
        &lt;body>
          &lt;/div>
              &lt;p>This is a paragraph tag&lt;/p>
              &lt;h1>This is a heading tag for titles&lt;/h1>
              &lt;a>This is a Anchor tag for links &lt;/a>
          &lt;/div>
        &lt;/body>
        
        &lt;/html>
      </code>
        <p>Not all HTML Elements are evident like the ones mentioned above. HTML5 introduced new semantic elements that adequately
        define the layout of a webpage, like the header, nav, section, and footer, to name a few.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Semantic elements help structure the code we use to create web page layouts. In other words, the exact name of the html5
          elements defines their purpose on a webpage layout. For example, The header element is used towards the top of a webpage
          to add introductory content to your webpage. Semantic elements help us differentiate the semantic elements of our markup
          from the ones we use solely for design, like the div element.</li>
          <li>The nav element is where we add a navigational area in the form of links to other web pages or other areas of our
          website. The main element is used to contain the main content of our website, and the section element is used to
          organize our main content. Finally, a footer element to wrap up the content and add closing information like resource
          links, author, or contact information.</li>
        </ul>
          <code>
                     <h3> Using HTML5</h3>
                      &lt;!DOCTYPE html>

        <p>In short, using generic HTML is entirely valid and works every time; it's just that html5 semantic elements are
        machine-readable elements that describe the webpage and make the HTML more comprehensible by better defining the
        different sections and layouts of web pages.</p>
        <p>The advancements of HTML5 makes web pages more informative and adaptable, which allows browsers and search engines to
        better interpret content found on a webpage, better known as SEO or search engine optimization. Since SEO helps web
        developer, toake advanatge of how your websites will reach your audience, we can build better websites by using HTML5.
        If you build a website and all you use are generic elements like divs, span, and other elements, your code will become
        less recognizable over time.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>A great deal of web content can be made accessible to everyone by using the correct Hypertext Markup Language elements
          in the right area. Use the correct HTML elements for their intended purpose as much as possible. Save you the hassle of
          having to go back and change it.</li>
          <li>Structural, semantic HTML is the crucial starting point toward good accessibility practices. When a screen reader or any
          assistive device scans a web page, it gets information about the Document Object Model (DOM) or the HTML structure of
          the page. A screen reader will read no styles or JavaScript.</li>
